This is fagbnc. Is a pretty cool guy; doesnt afraid of disconnect.

Dependencies: libsrsbsns, libsrsirc

Quickstart:
run ./autogen.sh to setup the autohell
afterwards, usual ./configure ; make ; make install stuff applies
configure will need CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS to contain "-I/usr/local ", and
  LDFLAGS to contain "-L/usr/local/lib ", provided libsrsirc and libsrsbsns
  were installed to /usr/local.

See INSTALL for generic autohell compile/install instructions.
